IMPORTANT CONTEXT — assess the person's real starting point before planning:
- Their current listed skills are: ${currentSkills}.
${levelContext}
- Do NOT assume prior programming or web development experience just because a skill like "JavaScript" or "React" is missing. If their current skills show no programming/scripting background at all (e.g. a background in an unrelated field like mechanical design, marketing, etc.), the roadmap MUST start from true fundamentals for that domain (e.g. for web development: what is a variable, HTML structure, CSS basics, then basic JavaScript syntax) BEFORE any framework, backend, or database topics.
- Only mark a topic "Intermediate" or "Advanced" if the person's current skills reasonably support jumping in at that level. If they are a genuine beginner in the domain, the first 1-2 weeks should be "Beginner" difficulty covering absolute basics, not skipped.
- The roadmap should feel achievable given where they are actually starting from, not just a generic list of the missing skill names.
